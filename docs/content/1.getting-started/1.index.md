description: Welcome to Ava, your very own personal assistant.
---

Ava is a personal assistant designed to be easy to use and highly customizable. It can help you with a variety of tasks, such as automating tasks, retrieving information, controlloing your smart home, and performing custom actions based on your needs.

Ava is built on top of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Text Embedding Models. You can configure Ava to use different LLMs and Text Embedding Model to suit your needs.

You can extend Ava's functionality by adding new skills, which are simply regular HTTP calls with instruction definitions for the LLMs to consider.

Ava can be set up in two ways:

- [Home Assistant Add-on and Component](/installation/haos) - The easiest way to get started with Ava.
- [Standalone Docker Container](/installation/standalone) - Run Ava on any machine with Docker.

API documentation is on the way, for now you can just use `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with `POST` same way as you would use OpenAI API to interact with your Ava instance. Compatablity is not guaranteed, but it should work for most use cases except for streaming.
